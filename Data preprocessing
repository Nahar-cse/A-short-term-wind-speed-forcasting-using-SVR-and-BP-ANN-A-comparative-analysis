Data cleansing or cleaning is one of the most important tasks for preparing a meaningful and useful experiment dataset from raw data. Only a furnished dataset can help to understand the hidden pattern of data changing into the dataset. The experiment dataset in this study has lots of “zero” values that created problem in activation or firing process of the models. To solve those problems, Leaky ReLu function was applied as rectifier in order to replace that “zero values” by some meaningful values which did not bring much changes in original dataset pattern
